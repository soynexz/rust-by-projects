# Rust by Projects

In my journey as a developer I have always tried to learn on the go. Look up how to do the thing I want to do as simple as possible and build up from there. Unfortunately, with Rust is not that easy. Coming from TypeScript, Rust is very complex. It's true that you don't need to make your code complex in order to make something awesome, but I feel that i'm missing out on some very cool features.

With this project my goal is to learn more things about Rust by:

- making projects based on their originals.
- getting very well known projects and trying to understand how they work.

I am not sure if this will work but it's the best thing I could think of.

The Rust book is not enough sometimes. Maybe reading the official documentation could help but I feel that this is the best way of them all.

I don't think that this will help anyone other than me, but if it does then it was even more worth it.
